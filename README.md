## Holy wally - challenge
Unfortunately, I had problems using `codesendbox` and I don't have a premium account in `CodePen`.

So I had to use github for that. As soon you the reviewers check the challenge I can quickly remove it.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
